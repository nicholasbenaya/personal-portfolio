          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            Hello there! I'm Nicholas Benaya, affectionately known as Nichol,
            hailing from the vibrant landscapes of Indonesia. Currently immersed
            in the world of self-taught Full-stack engineering, my journey into
            the realm of technology began as a passion for both hardware and
            software. While my roots lie in hardware, my mathematical inclination
            seamlessly led me into the captivating world of programming, where
            I've been honing my skills for the past year. Java has emerged as my
            programming language of choice, and I find immense joy in the
            intricate dance of code.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Beyond the screen and keyboard, you'll find me indulging in the
            cinematic realm during my leisure time, exploring the latest tech
            releases through the lens of Linus Tech Tips. As I navigate my
            educational path, my aspirations for the coming year include gaining
            admission to one of the most prestigious universities in my country,
            achieving expertise in programming, and evolving into the best version
            of myself. Join me on this exciting journey as I strive to merge my
            hardware enthusiasm with a mastery of code, all while embracing the
            diverse facets of personal growth and self-improvement.
